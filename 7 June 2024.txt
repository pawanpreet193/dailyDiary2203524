Greetings, 
        Java being a language that is strictly object oriented and doesn't even allow us to write a line of code without declaring a class is bit challenging and make it a syntax wise heavy language. Besides some cons , it do have a lot of pros. Getting ahead the today's class was more focussed about the functions, that how to initialise and declare them. It was quite strange to know that the functions in java are strictly Call by value that thry never allow us to use call by reference approach with some pointers. So one need to take care to this approach while calling a function in the main function, we can call the functions easily and store their results if they do return some value . They always work on the copy of the data being call by value. So overall functions are quite useful, helps reuse code and are bit handy.
