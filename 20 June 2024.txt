Greetings,
    Continuing with our bit manipulation journey, todayâ€™s focus was on practical applications and advanced techniques such as fast exponentiation.
1. Practical Examples:
Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of a number: Using n & (n - 1) repeatedly until n becomes zero.
Power of Two Check: A number is a power of two if n & (n - 1) == 0.
Reversing bits in a number: Implementing a function to reverse the bits of a given integer.
2. Fast Exponentiation using Bit Manipulation:
We also learned about fast exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring), which uses bit manipulation to efficiently compute powers. The algorithm involves:

Representing the exponent in binary.
Iterating through the bits of the exponent and multiplying the result by the base raised to the power of the current bit's position, if the bit is 1.
This session has equipped me with powerful tools for optimizing code performance, making me more proficient in handling complex problems efficiently. The hands-on examples solidified my understanding and demonstrated the practical benefits of bit manipulation.
