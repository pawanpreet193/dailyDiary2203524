Greetings,   
    Today's Java training session covered several interesting and practical topics. We began with a classic problem: swapping two numbers without using a third variable. This involved understanding and implementing arithmetic operations to interchange the values of two variables, which enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of variable manipulation.
Next, we delved into string manipulation, focusing on how to remove spaces from a string using the replace and replaceAll methods. These methods are powerful tools for processing and cleaning up text data, and learning their differences and applications was quite enlightening. replace is used for simple replacements, while replaceAll supports regular expressions for more complex string transformations.
Finally, we explored the conversion of binary numbers to decimal. This included writing a Java program that takes a binary string as input and converts it into its decimal equivalent. Understanding this conversion process is crucial for various computer science applications, including data encoding and network protocols.
Overall, the session was highly informative, equipping me with essential skills for both numerical and string data manipulation in Java.
