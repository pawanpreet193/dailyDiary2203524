Greetings, 
        Today's training was quite focussed on the application of the loops and functions. As to find out a prime number how difficult it is , along with being time consuming. Using the modulus operator a prime number can be easily found with a for or while loop. To make the program more efficient we can use the sqrt method under the Math class and run the loop till the square root of the given number, along with that created a program for Fibonacci series and after that for swapping the values of two variables, the thing that should be kept in mind while swapping is that Java works on only call by value, if we are creating a new function for swapping then it changes the values in the copies of the variables not the actual ones.
